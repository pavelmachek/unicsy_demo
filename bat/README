D4 can limit charge voltage to 4.1V, but not 4.0V

Droidian on OnePlus 6 does not allow charge voltage limit


Give me table between state of charge (volts) and battery longevity (years). Go down to 0%.

(robot says:)


Approximate Relationship Between State of Charge and Longevity

(Assuming room temperature, moderate cycling, full charge/discharge counted as 1 cycle)

State of Charge (SOC)	Cell Voltage (approx)	Typical Longevity (years, calendar life + cycle life)
100% (4.20 V)	4.20 V	~2–3 years (fast aging, high stress)
90%	4.15 V	~3–4 years
80%	4.05 V	~4–5 years
70%	3.95 V	~5–6 years
60%	3.87 V	~6–7 years
50%	3.80 V	~7–8 years (sweet spot, minimal stress)
40%	3.75 V	~7–8 years
30%	3.70 V	~6–7 years
20%	3.60 V	~5–6 years
10%	3.50 V	~3–4 years (deep cycling starts to hurt)
0% (cutoff)	<3.0 V	Permanent damage risk if stored; cell may die in months


Give me longevity vs. charge current (or maybe C) table.

Got it 👍 You’d like a table showing how charge current (C-rate) affects Li-ion longevity.

⚠ Reality filter:

C-rate = charge current ÷ nominal capacity (e.g., 1C = charging a 2000 mAh cell at 2000 mA).

Higher charge rates cause more heat, lithium plating, and SEI growth, which shorten cycle life.

Numbers below are approximate for typical consumer Li-ion (NMC / LiPo) cells, based on published test data. Actual results vary by chemistry and cooling.


⚡ Approximate Effect of Charge Current on Longevity
Charge Rate (C)	Example (for 2000 mAh cell)	Cycle Life (to 80% capacity)	Typical Longevity (years, daily use)	Notes
0.2C (gentle)	400 mA	~1500–2000 cycles	6–8 years	Very safe, minimal heating, but slow
0.5C (moderate)	1000 mA	~1000–1500 cycles	4–6 years	Common in laptops, some phones
1C (standard fast charge)	2000 mA	~500–800 cycles	2–4 years	Typical “fast charge” baseline
2C (aggressive fast charge)	4000 mA	~300–500 cycles	1–2 years	Higher heat, lithium plating risk
3C+ (extreme fast charge)	≥6000 mA	<200–300 cycles	<1 year	Only tolerable with special chemistries + cooling
