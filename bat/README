Charge modes

| max | I payed for 100% of battery and I'm going to use it                                                             |
| eco | Charge to 60%..80% percent. Good if you only need 40% of your battery (and can usually keep battery above 20%)  |
| AC  | Keep charge at 50%. Good for long-term storage or running at AC power, when you don't need your battery at all. |

L5 can limit charge voltage to 3.9V and above
D4 can limit charge voltage to 4.1V, but not 4.0V
Droidian on OnePlus 6 does not allow charge voltage limit


Give me table between state of charge (volts) and battery longevity (years). Go down to 0%.

(robot says:)


Approximate Relationship Between State of Charge and Longevity

(Assuming room temperature, moderate cycling, full charge/discharge counted as 1 cycle)

| S. of Charge | Cell Voltage    | Typical Longevity (years, calendar life + cycle life)   |
|         100% | 4.20 V          | ~2–3 years (fast aging, high stress)                    |
|          90% | 4.15 V          | ~3–4 years                                              |
|          80% | 4.05 V          | ~4–5 years                                              |
|          70% | 3.95 V          | ~5–6 years                                              |
|          60% | 3.87 V          | ~6–7 years                                              |
|          50% | 3.80 V          | ~7–8 years (sweet spot, minimal stress)                 |
|          40% | 3.75 V          | ~7–8 years                                              |
|          30% | 3.70 V          | ~6–7 years                                              |
|          20% | 3.60 V          | ~5–6 years                                              |
|          10% | 3.50 V          | ~3–4 years (deep cycling starts to hurt)                |
|           0% | (cutoff) <3.0 V | Permanent damage risk if stored; cell may die in months |

Give me longevity vs. charge current (or maybe C) table.

⚠ Reality filter:

C-rate = charge current ÷ nominal capacity (e.g., 1C = charging a 2000 mAh cell at 2000 mA).

Higher charge rates cause more heat, lithium plating, and SEI growth, which shorten cycle life.

Numbers below are approximate for typical consumer Li-ion (NMC / LiPo) cells, based on published test data. Actual results vary by chemistry and cooling.


⚡ Approximate Effect of Charge Current on Longevity

| Charge Rate (C)             | (for 2 Ah cell) | Life (to 80% capacity) | Longevity (daily use)  | Notes                                             |
| 0.2C (gentle)               | 400 mA          | ~1500–2000 cycles      | 6–8 years              | Very safe, minimal heating, but slow              |
| 0.5C (moderate)             | 1000 mA         | ~1000–1500 cycles      | 4–6 years              | Common in laptops, some phones                    |
| 1C (standard fast charge)   | 2000 mA         | ~500–800 cycles        | 2–4 years              | Typical “fast charge” baseline                    |
| 2C (aggressive fast charge) | 4000 mA         | ~300–500 cycles        | 1–2 years              | Higher heat, lithium plating risk                 |
| 3C+ (extreme fast charge)   | ≥6000 mA        | <200–300 cycles        | <1 year                | Only tolerable with special chemistries + cooling |

0.1C / 0.05C may be slightly better than 0.2C, but advantages are
diminishing after that.
